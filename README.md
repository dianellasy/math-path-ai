A Streamlit-based AI chatbot that helps Cal Poly SLO students with math placement questions and provides personalized guidance based on their academic records.

With 5,500 incoming students at Cal Poly SLO, students must be placed in a college math course. Many students have questions as to how they are being placed and if they need to take the Math Placement Exam (MAPE). Over 750+ emails and calls are directed to one staff member to answer questions about math placement. To combat the slow responses for the multiple repetitive questions, we created a chatbot that would answer students' most pressing, frequently asked questions regarding math placement in SLO.
